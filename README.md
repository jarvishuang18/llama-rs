**LLaMA-rs** is a Rust port of the
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) project. This allows running
inference for Facebook's [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)
model on a CPU with good performance using full precision, f16 or 4-bit
quantized versions of the model.

Just like its C++ counterpart, it is powered by the
[`ggml`](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) tensor library, achieving the same
performance as the original code.

## Getting started

Make sure you have a Rust 1.65.0 or above and C toolchain[^1] set up, and get a
copy of the model's weights[^2].

`llama-rs` is a Rust library, while `llama-cli` is a CLI application that wraps
`llama-rs` and offers basic inference capabilities.

The following instructions explain how to build `llama-cli`.

**NOTE**: For best results, make sure to build and run in release mode.
Debug builds are going to be very slow.

### Building using `cargo`

Run

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/rustformers/llama-rs llama-cli
```

to install `llama-cli` to your Cargo `bin` directory, which `rustup` is likely to
have added to your `PATH`.

It can then be run through `llama-cli`.

### Building from repository

Clone the repository, and then build it through

```shell
cargo build --release
```

The resulting binary will be at `target/release/llama-cli[.exe]`.

It can also be run directly through Cargo, using

```shell
cargo run --release -- <ARGS>
```

This is useful for development.

### Running

For example, try the following prompt:

```shell
llama-cli -m <path>/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Tell me how cool the Rust programming language is:"
```

Some additional things to try:

- Use `--help` to see a list of available options.
- If you have the [alpaca-lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) weights,
  try `--repl` mode!

  ```shell
  llama-cli -m <path>/ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin -f examples/alpaca_prompt.txt --repl
  ```

- Sessions can be loaded (`--load-session`) or saved (`--save-session`) to file. To automatically load
  and save the same session, use `--persist-session`. This can be used to cache prompts to reduce load
  time, too:

  (This GIF shows an older version of the flags, but the mechanics are still the same.)

[^1]:
    A modern-ish C toolchain is required to compile `ggml`. A C++ toolchain
    should not be necessary.

[^2]:
    The only legal source to get the weights at the time of writing is
    [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/README.md#llama).
    The choice of words also may or may not hint at the existence of other
    kinds of sources.

## Q&A

### Why did you do this?

It was not my choice. Ferris appeared to me in my dreams and asked me
to rewrite this in the name of the Holy crab.

### Seriously now.

Come on! I don't want to get into a flame war. You know how it goes,
_something something_ memory _something something_ cargo is nice, don't make
me say it, everybody knows this already.

### I insist.

_Sheesh! Okaaay_. After seeing the huge potential for **llama.cpp**,
the first thing I did was to see how hard would it be to turn it into a
library to embed in my projects. I started digging into the code, and realized
the heavy lifting is done by `ggml` (a C library, easy to bind to Rust) and
the whole project was just around ~2k lines of C++ code (not so easy to bind).
After a couple of (failed) attempts to build an HTTP server into the tool, I
realized I'd be much more productive if I just ported the code to Rust, where
I'm more comfortable.

### Is this the real reason?

Haha. Of course _not_. I just like collecting imaginary internet
points, in the form of little stars, that people seem to give to me whenever I
embark on pointless quests for _rewriting X thing, but in Rust_.

### How is this different from `llama.cpp`?

This is a reimplementation of `llama.cpp` that does not share any code with it
outside of `ggml`. This was done for a variety of reasons:

- `llama.cpp` requires a C++ compiler, which can cause problems for
  cross-compilation to more esoteric platforms. An example of such a platform
  is WebAssembly, which can require a non-standard compiler SDK.
- Rust is easier to work with from a development and open-source perspective;
  it offers better tooling for writing "code in the large" with many other
  authors. Additionally, we can benefit from the larger Rust ecosystem with
  ease.
- We would like to make `ggml` an optional backend
  (see [this issue](https://github.com/rustformers/llama-rs/issues/31)).

In general, we hope to build a solution for model inferencing that is as easy
to use and deploy as any other Rust crate.
